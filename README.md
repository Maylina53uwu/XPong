# XPong
Just a pong made on Scratch.

# Q : Why "X"Pong?
A : Since my pong is in the space, it made me think to Elon Musk who adds X everywhere and so I put a X.

# Why did you made this?
1. For fun
2. Because I CAN
3. Math Class

# Controls
(This is made for AZERTY keyboards. If you wanna modify the controls, just click on the sprite and change the keybinds.)
For Player 1, aka: left
Z: Up S: Down
For Player 2, aka: right
Up Arrow: Up Down Arrow: Down

# Known Issues

- Sometimes the ball can glitch and stay indefinitely if you don't move your racket. (It also fucks up the score)
- Controls get inverted when using variables for speed instead of using actual numbers
- Color of the ball doesn't change when interacting with the blue/right racket.

# Upcoming Features

- Fixing the 2nd and 3rd known issues (I'm not sure if the 1st one can be easily fixed)
- Make the ball speed up (and so the rackets) everytime the racket touch the ball
- Add an explosion sprite on the side of the player who lost
- Make my math teacher happy xD
